# Problem #3 [Medium]

## Problem Description

> Given the root to a binary tree, implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree.

## Implementation

I've written an implementation of serialize that determines the solution in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of Nodes in the Binary Tree.
