# Problem #20 [Easy]

## Problem Description

> Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

## Implementation

I've written an implementation that determines the solution in `O(n + m)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of elements in linked list 1, and `m` is the number of elements in linked list 2. It achieves constant space complexity `O(1)`.
