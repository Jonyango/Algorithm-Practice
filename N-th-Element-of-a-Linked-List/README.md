# N-th Element of a Linked List

## Problem Description

> Implement a function that finds the nth node in a linked list, **counting from the end.**
> Your function should take a linked list (its head element) and `n`, a positive integer as its arguments.
> If the given `n` is larger than the number of nodes in the list, return `null`.

## Solution

I've written an implementation that determines the solution in `O(n)` time complexity (worst case).
