# Is One Array a Rotation of Another

## Problem Description

> Write a function that returns True if one array is a rotation of another.
> Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` is a rotation of `[4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]`.
> NOTE: There are **_no duplicates_** in each of these arrays.
> REMINDER: Use lists instead of arrays in Python for simplicity.

## Solution

I've written an implementation that determines the solution in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of elements in array 1.

Languages Implemented:

- [JavaScript](./solution.js)
- [Python](./solution.py)
