# Rotating a 2D Array by 90 Degrees (In Place)

## Problem Description

> A 2-dimensional array is an array of arrays.
> Implement a function that takes a **square** 2D array (# columns == # rows) and rotates it by 90 degrees.
> Modify the content of the given array with `O(1)` extra space.

## Solution

I've written an implementation that determines the solution in `O(n^2)` time complexity, and `O(1)` extra space since the rotation is performed in place.
