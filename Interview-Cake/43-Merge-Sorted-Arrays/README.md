# Merge Sorted Arrays

## Problem Description

> In order to win the prize for most cookies sold, my friend Alice and I are going to merge our Girl Scout Cookies orders and enter as one unit. Each order is represented by an "order id" (an integer).
>
> We have our lists of orders sorted numerically already, in arrays. Write a function to merge our arrays of orders into one sorted array.

## Implementation

My solution completes the merge in `O(n)` time, and `O(n)` space, where `n` represents the total number of elements from both input arrays.
