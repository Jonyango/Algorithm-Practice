# Common Elements in Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Description

> Write a function that returns the common elements (as an array) between two sorted arrays of integers (ascending order).
> Example: The common elements between `[1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]` and `[1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10]` are `[1, 4, 9]`.
> REMINDER: Use lists instead of arrays in Python for simplicity.

## Solution

I've written an implementation that determines the solution in `O(max(n + m))` time complexity, where `n` is the number of elements in array 1, and `m` is the number of elements in array 2.
